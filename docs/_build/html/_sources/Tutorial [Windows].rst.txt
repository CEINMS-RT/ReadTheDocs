LowerLimbModel
--------------

Installation
++++++++++++

Installation of the ``LowerLimbModel`` is simple, 
go to the respective github repository and download the LowerLimbModel folder as zip or use git checkout on the LowerLimbModel page to download the files on your local machine. 
Next, make sure :ref:`CEINMS is completely installed <Download ref>` and the cfg folder is in place. 
Once this is ready we can copy the LowerLimbModel folder into the cfg folder. 
This LowerLimbModel folder should another folder called SplineCoeff which contains .bin files.
Move the SplineCoeff folder up one in the filetree so it's in the root of the cfg folder.

Usage
+++++

Using the LowerLimbModel is just like launching CEINMS normally, we only need to specify the right execution and subject xml in the run prompt and run the program.
for the LowerLimbModel, we use the executionRT.xml file and the subjectMTU.xml file. This will result in the following run command:

.. code-block:: console

    .\bin\Win\Debug\CEINMS.exe -e .\cfg\LowerLimbModel\executionRT.xml -s .\cfg\LowerLimbModel\subjectMTU.xml -g

What you will see is a skeleton on the right side of the screen and the emg data on the left.
